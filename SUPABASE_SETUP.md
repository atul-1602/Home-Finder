# Supabase Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up/login
2. Create a new project
3. Wait for the project to be set up (this may take a few minutes)

## Step 2: Get Your Project Credentials

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
2. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon/public key**
3. Update the `.env.local` file with your credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

## Step 3: Set Up the Database

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the contents of `supabase-setup.sql`
3. Paste it into the SQL editor and click **Run**
4. This will create the `properties` table with sample data

## Step 4: Verify the Setup

1. Go to **Table Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
2. You should see a `properties` table with 12 sample properties
3. The table should have all the columns: id, title, price, type, etc.

## Step 5: Test the Application

1. Restart your Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit your application - it should now load properties from Supabase

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "relation does not exist" error:
- Make sure you've run the SQL script in Step 3
- Check that your environment variables are correct
- Restart your development server after updating `.env.local`

### If you get authentication errors:
- Make sure you're using the **anon key** (not the service role key)
- Check that Row Level Security (RLS) policies are set up correctly

### If images don't load:
- The sample data uses placeholder image paths
- You can upload real images to your Supabase storage or use external URLs
